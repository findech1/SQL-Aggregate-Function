` 1.Data Drive `
Briefly explain any difficulties and 1 interesting thing you noticed about your chosen dataset.

My main challenge was importing the raw csv dataset into mysql workbench 
The was encoding error due to the cvs file 
I resolved it by doing data clleaning using https://app.datablist.com/d/anonymous/fcdb35bbc93846018a63
I was able to import the dataset into the schema succesflly

2. Data Fun
Count of users
SELECT COUNT(UserID) AS TotalUsers
FROM socialmedia.socialmediausers;

Avarage age of user
SELECT AVG(YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(DOB)) AS AverageAge
FROM socialmedia.socialmediausers;

Sum of users by gender
SELECT Gender, COUNT(UserID) AS TotalUsers
FROM socialmedia.socialmediausers
GROUP BY Gender;

2 Ask Why
Question 1: What are the most popular interests in each country?
SELECT Country, Interests, COUNT(UserID) AS TotalUsers
FROM socialmedia.socialmediausers
GROUP BY Country, Interests
ORDER BY Country, TotalUsers DESC;


SELECT City, COUNT(UserID) AS TotalUsers
FROM socialmedia.socialmediausers
WHERE Interests = 'Photography'
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY TotalUsers DESC;
